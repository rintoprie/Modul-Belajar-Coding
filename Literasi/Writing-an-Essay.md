# Writing an Essay
Source: https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/writing-your-essay    

## Write a first draft
Your first draft will help you work out:  
- the structure and framework of your essay
- how you will answer the question
- which evidence and examples you will use
- how your argument will be logically structured.  
Your first draft will not be your final essay; think of it as raw material you will refine through editing and redrafting. Once you have a draft, you can work on writing well.

## Structure
Structure your essay in the most effective way to communicate your ideas and answer the question.  
**All essays should include the following structure:**
1. Introduction
2. Body
3. Conclusion

## Essay paragraphs
A paragraph is a related group of sentences that develops one main idea. Each paragraph in the body of the essay should contain:
- a **topic sentence** that states the main or controlling idea
- **supporting sentences** to explain and develop the point you’re making
- **evidence** from your reading or an example from the subject area that supports your point
- **analysis** of the implication/significance/impact of the evidence finished off with a critical conclusion you have drawn from the evidence
- a **concluding sentence** that restates your point, analyses the evidence, or acts as a transition to the next paragraph.

## Tips for effective writing
- **Start writing early — the earlier the better**. Starting cuts down on anxiety, beats procrastination, and gives you time to develop your ideas.
- **Keep the essay question in mind**. Don’t lose track of the question or task. Keep a copy in front of you as you draft, edit and work out your argument.
- **Don’t try to write an essay from beginning to end**, especially not in a single sitting. Begin with what you are ready to write—a plan, a few sentences or bullet points. Start with the body and work paragraph by paragraph.
- **Write the introduction and conclusion after the body**. Once you know what your essay is about, then write the introduction and conclusion.
- **Use 'signpost' words in your writing**. Transition signals can help the reader follow the order and flow of your ideas.
- **Integrate your evidence carefully**. Introduce quotations and paraphrases with introductory phrases.
- **Revise your first draft extensively**. Make sure the entire essay flows and that the paragraphs are in a logical order.
- **Put the essay aside for a few days**. This allows you to consider your essay and edit it with a fresh eye.
