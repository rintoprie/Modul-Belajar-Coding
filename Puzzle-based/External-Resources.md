Propose Scratch Design Studio Themes!  
https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/93627/  
Do you have an idea for a future Scratch Design Studio?  
  
Make a project that:  
- Describes your theme  
- Includes a link to your example project (shown below; optional)  
  
Optionally, make an additional project that:  
- Is an example of your theme  
  
If you like, you can share your idea by remixing this template project created by stevetheipad: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2397408  
  
SDS themes should be broad enough so that Scratchers of all ages, interests, and experience levels can participate.  
To have your project added, please post a comment with a link. You can find a link to your project by clicking the “Embed” button on the project page. The link will be directly below the Facebook logo.

Interactive Stories  
https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4823590/  
This is the “Interactive Stories” Scratch Design Studio!  
  
In this SDS, create a Scratch project which is an interactive story! Your story can be anything from a narrative about tacos on a quest for cheese to unicorns dancing their way across town to anything else you can imagine - but you must make it interactive!  
  
Here are some ideas to help you get started:
- Make things you can click to make them move and change
- Create mini games you can play within the story
- Make buttons you can use to pick what happens next in the story
